# 1D Cellular Automata simulation in Python

This is something I did for my Complex System course.

You can change the number of neighbours, the rule you use, the number of states for each automata, how many iterations and how many cells you want to simulate.

You can also switch randomly choose all of these and just see it go!

Uses Pygame for the display part.

In the image below we can see the default parameters: 2 states, 31 cells, initialized with just one set to state 1 at the top, using rule 30, for 15 iterations. This is Wolfram's favourite cellular automata, as described in his book "A New Kind of Science".
